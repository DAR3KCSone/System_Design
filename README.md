# System_Design

Q: Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

A: The DriverPass project had been a system requested by the DriverPass client. The client works with their customers to prepare them for both the written and in-person testing for acquiring their driver's license. In essence, the system requested by the client was a cloud-based application which allowed their customers to login and take online classes for the written test, take practice tests, and schedule/track in-person driving lessons with one of the client's driving instructors. 

Q: What did you do particularly well?

A: Thoughout this project, I would say that I composed the diagrams quite well. Ambiguity is not something I enjoy leaving in any of the documentation I create. As such, I intentionally designed the diagrams throughout this course to contain the information directly provided by the client without drawing my own conclusions. 

Q: If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

A: The single part of my work that I would hope to revise is my descriptions of the numerous topics found throughout this course in my assignments. Including more detail of the "why?" behind the topics as well as a few real-world examples would have improved my own understanding. 

Q: How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

A: Using the provided interview transcript, I directly took the requests of the user and formatted them into the system design. One of the major issues which one can encounter is the missunderstanding or misinterpretation of a user request when developing a product only to discover later that it has been created wrong. With this, I stuck as closely to the requests of the client as possible while leaving little to nothing to interpretation. In the end, the user/client is the individual the product is to be catered to. Thus, it is important to ensure that what is supplied matches what they request.

Q: How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

A: My design approach is much different to that displayed in a common practice (for my own projects). First, I begin developing what I believe the system should look like while keeping true to object oriented programming. Next, I will begin cataloging the required elements which I have defined within the system before removing what is absolutely not required. Following this, I will develop the diagrams discussed within this course (mainly the class diagram. Finally, I will begin to polish the code to what I believe it should be. In the future, I plan to use the plethora of diagrams and documentation referenced within this course to clearly convey my own ideas to my team.
